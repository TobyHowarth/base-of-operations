Base of Operations
==================

My Boilerplate Starting Point created with the magic of Sass

----------------------

Hello, this is my starting point for all front end projects (or it might well be once it is completed)

This will be an ongoing 'thing' and will change often(ish) when I find and use newer styles and code skills in the future.

----------------------

Some Thanks


- Stu Robson for helping and for checking my code.
- Semantic.gs for being awesome and Nose nation for creating this https://github.com/Light-SCSS-Semantic.gs to fix a few issues in the nesting.
- Inuit.css for giving me ideas to get me moving
