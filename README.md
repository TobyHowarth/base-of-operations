Base of Operations - My Boilerplate Starting Point

Hello, this is my starting point for all front end projects (or it might well be once it is completed)

This will be an ongoing 'thing' and will change often(ish)

Some Thanks


- Stu Robson for helping and for checking my code.
- Semantic.gs for being awesome and Nose nation for creating this https://github.com/Light-SCSS-Semantic.gs to fix a few issues in the nesting.
